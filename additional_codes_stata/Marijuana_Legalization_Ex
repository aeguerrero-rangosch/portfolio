//Merging Data
**********************

//we first want to merge the fatalities and popilation data to be able to use both in regressions
//we want to match the variable names in both data sets and sort equally to merge properly
rename state state_names		//renaming states variable in fatalities data to match the variable name in population data
sort state_names year 			//sorting to assure that the data sets are merged successfully
save fatalities_merged			//saving a separate .dta file in which we will merge both data sets
clear all						//clearing the data to import the population data set

//we now want to import and prepare the population data set to merge with the fatalities data set
import delimited C:\Users\aless\OneDrive\Desktop\states_population.csv	//importing the population data set
sort state_names year													//sorting equally to assure merging with the fatalities data
merge m:m state_names using fatalities_merged							//merging "many to many" state variables from each data sets using out new .dta file
drop _merge																//dropping _merge variable that holds no relevant information
save fatalities_population_merged										//save a new .dta file that holds fatalities and population merged data
clear all																//clear all data to import legalization data set

import delimited C:\Users\aless\OneDrive\Desktop\marijuana_legalization_status.csv //importing legalization data set
sort state_names																   //sorting equally to merge with fatalities_population_merged
merge 1:m state_names using fatalities_population_merged						   //merging "one to many" state variables from the merged data set and legalization data set
drop _merge																		   //dropping _merge variable that holds no relevant information

//Figures

//saving figure onto figure filepath

//creating the second figure and creating our future regressand: fatalities per capita

//saving figure onto figure filepath

//creating the third figure and creating new categorical variable for future regression
egen state_cat = group(state_names), label					//creating a categorical variable from the string of states (called state_names from merging) to regress later
twoway line fatalities_per_capita year, by(state_cat)		//creating a series of time-series (1997-2017) graphs of fatalities per capita by state

//Data Manipulation

sort state_names year											//sorting again to assure data looks clean and is easy to follow

//to perform the regressions in this section, we want to build several dummies for our different regressors
//creating the dummies for whether or not marijuana is wholly legal or illegal
generate illegal_dummy = 0										//creating a dummy for illegal, assuming "legal"
replace illegal_dummy = 1 if treatment_effective_year == 0		//if illegal dummy = 1, we assume marijuana is illegal

//creating the dummies for whether or not enforcement and legislation is stringent and strict
generate control_dummy = 0										//creating a dummy for control, assuming "lax/not stringent"
replace control_dummy = 1 if control == "TRUE"					//if control dummy = 1, we assume "stringent/strict"
	
//creating the dummies for whether or not recreational marijuana is legal (medical marijuana notwithstanding)
generate recreational_dummy = 1									//creating a dummy for recreational, assuming "legal" for 1
replace recreational_dummy = 0 if treatment_effective_year == 0	//if illegal dummy = 0, we assume recreational marijuana is illegal

sort state_names												//sorting again to assure data looks clean and is easy to follow			

//now we want to create a continuous variable from the weights columns in legalization data, to see if upon the effective date of legalization affect crashes
gen weighted_medical = 0										//creating a variable for effective date of medical marijuana
gen weighted_effective = 0										//creating a variable for effective date of recreational marijuana

//we essentially want to set the weights given at the date in which marijuana was legalized
//weights are done by the fraction of days remaining in the year after effective date of legalization 
replace weighted_medical = medical_legalization_weights			//put in the weights into the new variable for medical marijuana
replace weighted_medical = 0 if medical_legalization_year > year//if the year of legalization is greater than the year total, keep the 0 (still not legalized)
replace weighted_medical = 1 if medical_legalization_year < year//if the year of legalization is lesser than the year total, subsitute in a 1 full year legalized)
replace weighted_medical = 0 if medical_legalization_year == 0	//replace 0 for all years 0

replace weighted_effective = treatment_effective_weights		 //put in the weights into the new variable for recreational marijuana
replace weighted_effective = 0 if treatment_effective_year > year//if the year of legalization is greater than the year total, keep the 0 (still not legalized)

//Regression
**********************

//our first regression, for the sake of looking at all the data, contains the state categorical variable to see the state effects
//i chose to exclude the recreational dummy from this regression because it makes a lot of other dummies collinear, which confuses the output 
regress fatalities_per_capita i.illegal_dummy i.control_dummy i.state_cat weighted_effective weighted_medical, noconstant

//store the estimates from this regression: a simpler regression excluding the (unnecessary) state effects, but keeping all other regressors from before
//then exporting the regression table from stata to a latex document for visual purposes

//this first regression (1) relies only on the dummies, and only if control assumed 0, storing at est1
eststo: regress fatalities_per_capita i.control_dummy i.illegal_dummy if control_dummy == 0

//this second regression (2) relies only on the dummies, and only if illegal assumed 1, storing at est2

//this regression i chose to exclude, as setting the control 1 creates a collinearity problem
